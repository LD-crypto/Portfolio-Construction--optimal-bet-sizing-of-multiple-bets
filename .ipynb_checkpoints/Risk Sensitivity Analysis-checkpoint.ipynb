    "# Risk Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous analysis it seems that the optimal bet size for multiple identical bets quickly converges to 99.99% of the portfolio being used. The optimal size for a single bet with specific paramters was found to be 40% and when 3 of the same bets are used the optimal size jumps to 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious problem with this analysis is that one needs the exact payoff profile and probabilities of winning to find the optimal bet size. In the real world the payoffs and outcomes often have much more uncertainties. The sensitivty of the optimal size to various win_probabilties will be investigated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same Toy Bet as in previous notebooks will again be investigted. The Toy Bet is one in whch there is a binary outcome. The bet wins with some probabiltiy P, and when it wins the return is +20% on the bet size and when it loses the entire bet is lost resulting in a return of -100%. The win probabiltity will be set tp 0.90 +- 0.1. The optimal bet size (K) and the resulting geometric expected value (GEV) of multiple bets will be investigated over thos range.\n",

    "The above result set indicates that the optimal bet size is very sensitive to the accuracy of the probabiltity. Just a single 1% difference in expected win probability results in a 6% difference in K. Another interesting observation is that the change in K is exactly 6% for every 1% increase or decrease in win probabiltity. It is a direct linear relationship.\n",

    "Due to this high linear relationship the optimal K can vary from 0% to 99% over a range of only +-10% in estimates of the win probabiltity. This is very sensitive. This analysis on its own cannot tell us much about the expected variance in GEV of the bet. However the x6 sensitivty may be helpful to use to investigate the GEV of the bet over a range of uncertainty in the actual win probabiltity while holding the K fixed. I.e. given our estimates of the bet structure (win probabiltity, payouts, etc.) and uncertainty we can estimate a K for the bet and then test to see the sensitivty of the GEV of this K given uncertainty estimates of the estimates of bet structure."
