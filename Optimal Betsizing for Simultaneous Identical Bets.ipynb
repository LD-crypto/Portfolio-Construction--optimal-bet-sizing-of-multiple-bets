    "# Optimal Betsizing for Simultaneous Identical Bets\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of an investing, trading or betting system is to maximize the ending wealth of the user. The metric that a portfolio constructor should aim to optimize to reach this goal is the compound growth rate (CGR).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will investigate a method and algorithm to estimate the optimal portfolio of bets to maximize the CGR.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimal Single Bet Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kelly Criterion is a well known method to calculate the optimal betsize of a bet with known porbabilities and payout.\n",
    "\n",
    "${K} = \\frac{P}{L} - \\frac{{1-P}}{W}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where K is the percentage of the portfolio/bankroll to allocate to the bet, P is the porbability that the bet wins, L is the percentage loss from losing and W is the percentage gain from winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to calculate the optimal bets size K is the start with the geometric expected value GEV of a bet and find the K that maximizes this geometric expectation. The geometric expected value is the exponent of the arethmetic mean of the log ending wealth of the outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to make some assumptions and state a toy bet to use for this analysis. The major assumptions are that all the outcomes of the bets independant and they all have the same probabilities and payout structure. This allows the for simplification of the problem. Each bet should now be allocated with the same amount of capital and the total amount allocated to all bets will be of size K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us state the toy bet. The bet has two outcomes; a win with probability of P and payout of W; and a loss with probability 1-P and a payout of L.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples to follow will be set to P = 0.9; W = 0.2; and L = -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loss of -1 means that when the bet loses the entire capital is lost. A real life example of this might be in a DeFi lending protocol where the interest is a fixed amount but there is a non-zero chance of hack, bugs, or scams that result in entire investment lost.\n",

As with most diversification, such as seen with a modern portfolio theory, this greatest reductions in risk comes from the first few additional diversifiers."
